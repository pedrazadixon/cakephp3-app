[![License](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/cakephp/app.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/cakephp/app)

A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) 3.x. The skeleton has been preloaded with the [Acl](https://github.com/cakephp/acl), [AclManager](https://github.com/ivanamat/cakephp3-aclmanager) plugins. Manages groups, roles, users and ACL.

## Loaded plugins
* The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).
* The Acl plugin source code can be found here: [cakephp/acl](https://github.com/cakephp/acl).
* The AclManager plugin source code can be found here: [ivanamat/cakephp3-aclmanager](https://github.com/ivanamat/cakephp3-aclmanager).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist pedrazadixon/cakeapp app_name`.

If Composer is installed globally, run
```bash
composer self-update && composer create-project --prefer-dist pedrazadixon/cakeapp app_name
```

You should now be able to visit the path to where you installed the app and see
the setup traffic lights.

## Configuration

### MySQL

Import the `config/schema/cakephp.sql` file to your database.

### APP
Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the 'Datasources' and any other
configuration relevant for your application.

Uncomment `$this->Auth->allow();` from initialize function on `AppController`. This lets you create Groups, Roles and Users.

    public function initialize() {
        
        ...
        
        // Only for ACL setup
        $this->Auth->allow();
    }

Uncumment `return true;` from isAuthorized function on `AppController`. This allows you to access the Acl Manager plugin.

    public function isAuthorized($user) {
        
        // Only for ACL setup
        return true;
        
        ...

    }
    
## Create the first group, the main role and the first user.

* Now go to the Groups area and create your first group.
* Access Roles area and create a new role for the group you created. It is recommended to create the first role with the name 'Root'. The role you have created with id 1 will always have all permissions.
* Create a user with the group and role you just created.
* Log in on `/Users/login` as the user created, go to `/AclManager` and click on `Restore to default` to create ACOs and AROs automatically. 

## Comment the uncommented

Comment `$this->Auth->allow();` from initialize function and `return true;` from isAuthorized function on `AppController`.

    public function initialize() {
        parent::initialize();
        ...
        
        // Only for ACL setup
        // $this->Auth->allow();
    }
    
    public function isAuthorized($user) {
        // Only for ACL setup
        // return true;
        
        ...
    }


## Enjoy!

Now you can start customizing your permissions and Develop your app. Do not forget to update the ACOs when creating new functions.
